#Unauthorised Vehicle Detection


In the present scenario Automated System for Car parking and Vehicle Monitoring has become the major issue in most of the areas like Business Complexes, tolls, Residential Areas etc.. So we have come up with a solution of Automatic Number plate Recognition in order to identify vehicles that are entering into a particular Residential Complex Area / Gated Society. Our model accepts a CCTV video as input and finally retrieves the Vehicle Number as a string. We implement this in 4 steps, namely -  Vehicle Image Acquisition, Number Plate Recognition, Character Segmentation, Character Recognition. 
	For Residential complexes, we have designed an web application for the Residents, Watchmen, and Head of the Residential complex for monitoring the movement of vehicles(in & out). Each has separate web interface and database for them. Residents register their details & vehicle numbers and can view their log. Watchmen will monitor vehicles that are entering & exiting and also enters the details of the visitors if an unknown vehicle is detected. The Head of the society will be provided with full access of everything so that he can monitor. 
        For managing parking in Business complexes, we designed a web application for people to pre-book a parking slot and when their vehicle is detected, a mail is sent to him with an empty parking slot number which is generated automatically. For other people ,the Watchman allocates, and an empty slot is generated automatically. When this vehicle is detected at the out-gate ,the time the vehicle stayed inside the parking will be calculated and an automated bill is generated according to it.
